## Strategy
* Universal strategy
   * target below current min
* Possible strategies
   * only keep specific dice values
     * take only 3 or lowest
     * take only 3,1
     * take only 3,2,1
   * TakeHigherDiceLater
     * take higher dice when having fewer remaining
     * four variations with increasing risk-taking
   * PremeditatedTarget
     * if going before other competitors, pick a target based upon number of people playing after you.
     * multiple variations based on target
